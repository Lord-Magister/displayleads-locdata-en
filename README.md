repo for location data for display leads addon.

Hopefully this will help with translations staying in sync.

As Location data keeps evolving. Translations will soon be outdated and for translators to know what has changed is a pain.

Github diff should allow to highlight what has changed in the english version since last translation pass.
Thus allowing to update affected location entries easily
